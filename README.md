### 🏠 **BASES**

Your base is your safe haven. When you're in it, you are **protected** from any damage and most crowd control (CC) effects like stuns and knockback!

### ⚙️ **SETTINGS**

You can customize your experience in the settings menu:

* **🎮 Player mode** · There are 3 player modes available:

  * 💀 *Kill mode* is the boring, no-customizations mode. 
  * ❄️ *Chill mode* is the default mode, allowing you to customize your experience to its *maximum* potential! You can still die, though.
  * 🧘 *Zen mode* makes you *protects* you from any damage and most CC effects but prevents you from using your abilities (like you're inside your base!).

* **🏡 Base mode** · There are 5 base modes available:

  * ➡️ *Passive* bases don't really do anything (aside from having their own speed, gravity, noclip, etc., that apply to other players as well).
  * 👁️ *Hidden* bases are only visible to their owners, hiding them when they're inside, and they don't apply their base settings to other players.
  * 🌐 *Friendly* bases protect other players, and allow them to fast travel to it.
  * 🚫 *Repulsive* bases refuse entry, blocking other players from entering.
  * 💀 *Hostile* bases are like repulsive ones, but inflict damage to players who try to enter.

* **🎮 Gameplay customizations** · Third-person mode with multiple camera settings, trampoline mode, riding other players, and more!

* **✨ Ability and ultimate customizations** · Tweak stuff like damage, healing, and thorns! You can also enable ability and ultimate spam if you wanna be annoying.

* **🎨 Custom messages, auras, outlines, rainbows** · Personalize your hero's appearance!

* **🌙 Dream mode** · Turn your game into a screensaver!

* **🔧 ...and more!**
