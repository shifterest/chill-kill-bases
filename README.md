### 🏠 ==**BASES**==

Once you enter your base, you are 🛡️ protected from any damage and most crowd control (CC) effects such as stuns and knockback!

### ⚙️ ==**SETTINGS**==

You can customize your hero or base in the settings menu! Here are some notable settings:

* **🎮 ==Player mode==** · There are 2 player modes available:

  * 💀 *Kill mode* is the boring, no-customizations mode. 
  * ❄️ *Chill mode* is the default mode, allowing you to customize your experience to their *maximum* potential! You can still die, though.
  * 🧘 *Zen mode* makes you *invulnerable* to damage and most CC effects (like when you're inside your base!), but prevents you from using your abilities (also like when you're inside your base!).

* **🏡 ==Base mode==** · There are 5 base modes available:

  * ➡️ *Passive* bases don't really do much (aside from having their own speed, gravity, noclip, etc., that apply to other players as well).
  * 👁️ *Hidden* bases are only visible to their owners, hide them when they're inside, and don't apply their base settings to other players.
  * 🌐 *Friendly* bases protects others players, and allows them to fast travel to it.
  * 🚫 *Repulsive* bases refuse entry, blocking other players from entering.
  * 💀 *Hostile* bases act much like repulsive ones, but influct damage to players who try to enter.

* **🎮 ==Gameplay customizations==** · Third-person mode with multiple camera settings, trampoline mode, riding other players, and more!

* **✨ ==Ability and ultimate customizations==** · Tweak stuff like damage, healing, and thorns! You can also enable ability and ultimate spam if you wanna be annoying 💥💉🌀

* **🎨 ==Custom messages, auras, outlines==** · Personalize your hero! There's even a 🌈 rainbow option 😱

* **🌙 ==Dream mode==** · The ultimate AFK experience, if you ask me 😴📺

* **🔧 ==...and more!==**
